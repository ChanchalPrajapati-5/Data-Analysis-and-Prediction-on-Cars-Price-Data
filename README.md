# Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-on-Cars-Price-Data
Data Analysis Project - Car Price Prediction - Using Python  1. Data Wrangling - Cleaned the data with(205 rows * 26 columns) - Missing value treatment and formatting. 2. Exploratory Data Analysis - Found relation of target variable ”Price” with others using correlation, heatmaps and boxplot. 3. Model Devlopment and Evaluation - Using SLR and MLR model to fit given data and checking efficiency using MSE and R Sq. Found that MLR model with 6 variables fits best on data with R sq value 0.81. 4. Training and Testing - Taking testing data as 10% of total, R sq was found to be 0.88 so model explained 88% of variation in ”Price” of cars.
